# The Hoard Roguelike Mode

This repository captures design notes and implementation guides for "The Hoard," a roguelike-inspired game mode layered onto Dungeons & Dragons 5e for use inside Roll20. The material here converts sprawling design prompts into structured documentation so the tabletop team can collaborate on scripts, card decks, and facility systems.

* `docs/` — Reference documentation for currencies, decks, and facilities.
* `LICENSE` — Licensing information.

As implementation assets (Roll20 macros, card templates, API scripts) are produced they should be stored alongside this documentation.
